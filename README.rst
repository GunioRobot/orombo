=============
Orombo Primer
=============

Orombo, simply put, is about conversations on the things we find interesting 
on the web.

The project is inspired by the need to have an online community where developers 
in Nigeria (and Africa) can discuss and have conversations about the things 
they are interested in.

The nature of the community is somewhat similar to what's currently available 
at reddit.com except that the developers have decided to write something similar 
simply for learning purposes instead of installing reddit which is actually 
open source.

Developers
----------

Developers are welcome to contribute towards building this. 

**Git**
In order to contribute code to the project, you should be familiar with the git 
source code versioning system and how projects are managed on github.com.

We realise that quite a number of developers are likely to be using code 
versioning for the first time and to help out, there are materials and books 
out there that can help you get up to speed as quickly as possible.

The git community book is available at http://book.git-scm.com/

A git cheatsheet is available online and can be downloaded and printed from 
http://zrusin.blogspot.com/2007/09/git-cheat-sheet.html

You can also go through the guides on using git (and github in particular) at 
http://github.com/guides/Home

**Django**
Development is currently being done using the python-based Django framework. 
You can learn more about Django by visiting http://www.djangoproject.com/

Mailing list
------------

We've also setup a mailing list to co-ordinate and have discussions about the 
project. You're welcome to join us in the discussions (whether or not 
you're a developer). Visit http://groups.google.com/group/orombo to subscribe.
